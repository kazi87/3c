# Charlene's Coffee Corner
Recently, Charlene decided to open her very own little coffee shop on a busy street corner.
Being the careful entrepreneur, she decided to start off with a limited offering, with the option to expand her choice of products, as business goes.

## Her Offering
- Coffee (small, medium, large) 2.50 CHF, 3.00 CHF, 3.50 CHF
- Bacon Roll 4.50 CHF
- Freshly squeezed orange juice (0.25l) 3.95 CHF
## Extras:
- Extra milk 0.30 CHF
- Foamed milk 0.50 CHF
- Special roast coffee 0.90 CHF

# Your task is to:
Write a simple program whose output is formatted like a receipt you would receive at a supermarket.
The input to the program is a list of products the shopper wants to purchase (large coffee with extra milk, small coffee with special roast, bacon roll, orange juice)
